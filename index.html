      <p>Optical laser communication between a ground station and a moving object.</p>
    </section>

 <section id="overview" class="section">
  <div class="section-title">Project Overview</div>
  <p>Our project was a laser communication system that had two main components: <br> A receiver and a transmitter. <br><br>
    The transmitter's purpose was two main things:<br> Track the receiver's IR LEDs, and encode data at a goal transmission rate of 10 kBits/sec. <br> <br>
    The receiver had two of its own goals: <br> Read if a laser is hitting it, and process whatever data the laser may be sending.<br><br>
    Ultimately, this system allows us to move the reciever anywhere within a 30 foot range, and the laser will be able to track it, and beam it
    data using our laser.

 <section id="concept" class="concept section">
      <div class="section-title">Concept</div>
      <p>We build and operate a laser-based optical communication link that maintains continuous data flow between a fixed ground station and a moving target. Precision pointing, adaptive beam control, and deterministic software keep latency predictable and throughput stable in dynamic conditions.</p>

      <p> This a photograph of our (near) final reciever and transmitter builds. Note this does not show the STM32 on the 
        transmitter side as we were unable to integrate the software. </p>

        <p>This is a short video that shows our project in action. You can see we hold the reciever, and move it around. On the reciever, the laser hits the lens in the middle
        The camera tracking allows the laser to stay right on the middle of the lens at all times. The data transmission part of the project did not end up working for testing. 
        You can also on the monitor in the video what the camera vision looks like, which should show that the IR LED stays on 
        the center of the screen.

    <section id="design" class="section">
      <div class="section-title">Design Process</div>
      <p> Tracking system design process: <br><br> For this part of the project we struglled most intially
        with deciding what type of motors would be best for the type of precision we were hoping to achieve.
        We origiinally thought of a gimbal motor, but after looking into it, though it can be very accurate, that is only possible
        with good motor control which we thought would be a limiting factor. So, we decided to move to either stepper motors. After deciding what motors to use,
        we had to figure out how to use actually see the IR leds on the reciever. We bought a NOIR camera that allows us to see IR light, and with it coming with a 22 pin
        connector we were able to connect it to a raspberry pi, that would allow us to process the info. This created a problem for us as we controlled the motors with an arduino
        (originally chosen for being on hand when starting the project). Since we had to introduce a feedback system between the camera and the motors, we had to connect
        the arduino and raspebrry pi together to send data between the two. We found this less than ideal and made our components grow more than needed. So, we decided to switch motor control over to the raspberry pi,
        making it control both our camera vision software as well as our motor control software simulatneously.<br><br>
        On the reciever side of the tracking, we originally decided to use a breadboard IR LED. However, after testing, we found them to be much too weak to actually be spotted by our gimbal system. So, we switched to a
        3W IR led that was much more powerful and worked great for our camera vision. To power the LEDs we originally powered them with a double-A battery pack. This caused problems later on, however, as since we used no
        resistors (we opted not to as we wanted to draw as much power as possible for our LEDs, though is not best practice) our batteries died incredbly fast. After a few cases of people forgetting to unplug the batteries after use,
        we had killed all the double-A batteries accessible to us. Due to time constrants of getting batteries, as well as money constraints, we switched to 9V batteries we had access to. More info on the process of the tracking system
        is explained our software section. <br><br>


        Laser transmission design process: <br><br>
          For the laser transmission system, we deliberately chose a bare-metal STM32 platform to maximize our learning and minimize abstraction. Working directly on the STM32 allowed us to interact with low-level hardware features, timers, and ADCs, giving us full control over the transmission and reception process, though it does come with difficulties in that we cannot debug easily, do not fully understand what is going on, and makes development process harder.<br><br>
          For the optical receiver, we selected BPW34 photodiodes due to their accessibility and reasonable sensitivity for our visible-range laser. Initially, we planned to design a more sophisticated electrical front end, including a transimpedance amplifier (TIA) to convert the photodiode current to voltage. However, testing revealed that a simple resistor in series with the photodiode provided sufficient voltage output for detection. This simplified our design, reduced part count, and made debugging more straightforward.<br><br>
          We decided to use Manchester line encoding for data transmission. Manchester encoding offered two key advantages: it embeds clock information within the signal, allowing for simpler synchronization between the transmitter and receiver, and it is relatively straightforward to implement in software while still being robust enough to handle noise and timing variations in our setup.<br><br>
          We targeted a data transmission rate of 10 kbits/sec, which is a good balance in between complexity/difficulty and utility of usage. We planned on using this data to play a speaker, where the frequency depended on the transmitter - effectively playing a song.<br><br>
          Despite these careful design choices, the final decoding software on the STM32 did not function as intended. Extensive debugging did not reveal the root cause, but we believe this difficulty stems from mistiming our samples and the way we interfaced with the STM32 peripherals for high-speed sampling and signal decoding. In hindsight, the better approach would have been to first start with something like an Arduino, and then move forward with an STM32 after we had gotten a base decoding system working, taking full advantage of the Arduino's ease of use compared to the STM32. This would have allowed us to focus on the decoding algorithm instead of worrying about low level hardware interfacing code.<br><br>
          We did manage to detect light, and decode bits individually during testing. We were able to have the speaker play certain tones based on the presence of the laser, which did help with debugging the tracking part of our project.

      <p>This chart shows the tracking system and our transmision system. You can see the camera watches the IR leds and based
        on where those are it will send data to the motors to move the system in the right direction. In the transmission system you 
        can see the STM32 on transmission side controlling the laser, that then shines through a convex lens to make the laser point converge
        onto the photodiode and that information is then sent to recieving side STM32 for processing.

      <p>This chart represents how energy and data flow through our project. You can see how both the tracking system
        and the reciever interact to be able to correcly transmit data through our laser and into our photodiode to be able to
        be translated by our STM32 on the reciever side.
