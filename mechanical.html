      <div class="section-title">Our Ground Station</div>
      <img src="images/ground_station_assem.png" alt="Project image">
      <p>This image is our final assmebly for our ground station. It is entirly 3d printed. It features holdings for 
        two stepper motors, a raspberry pi, a lithium battery, two stepper motor drivers, a portable charger, and our camera. 
      </p>
    <section class="section">
      <div class="section-title">X-base stepper driver</div>
      <img src="images/x_stepper_holder.png" alt="Project image">
      <p>This part of the ground station holds our x-axis parts. This includes a motor driver (goes in right compartment), and our stepper motor
        (goes in left compartment). In the right compartment, room is also left to hold our lithium battery. 
      </p>
       <section class="section">
      <div class="section-title">X-base stepper driver covers</div>

      <div class="image-row">
        <img src="images/bottom_side_cover.png" alt="Project image">
        <img src="images/driver_cover.png" alt="Project image">
        <img src="images/top_side_cover.png" alt="Project image">
      </div>

      <p>These parts all make up the covers that go on to the x-base stepper driver. The right image is the top side cover and 
        the left image is the bottom side cover. These were split into two parts to allow us to feed the power wires through the 
        made holes to easily let us plug and unplug our ground station. The top cover (middle image) then covers the right compartment, and comes with a hole 
        through it to allow us to feed the wires from the motor driver that need to connect to the raspberry pi. All parts including the motor are 
        screw pressed onto our ground station.
      </p>
      <div class="section-title">Y Axis Stepper Holder</div>
      <img src="images/y_axis_stepper_holder.png" alt="Project image">
      <p>This is another main part that makes up our ground station. It holds our stepper motor for our y-axis movement (right compartment) for our tracking
        system, as well as the motor driver for it (left compartment). It also has a spot right above where the motor compartment is to put our portable charger onto.
        This charger then powers our Raspberry Pi. 
      </p>
       <div class="section-title">Raspberry Pi Cover</div>
      <img src="images/rasp_pi_cover.png" alt="Project image">
      <p>This cover goes above the motor driver compartment to both cover the wiring around the motor driver and hold our
        Raspberry Pi. The cover, a lot like our top x axis cover, has a cut in it to allow for feeding wires. It then has edges that
        stick out to allow us to press fit the Raspberry Pi into them.
      </p>
       <div class="section-title">Camera and Laser Holder</div>
      <img src="images/camera_holder.png" alt="Project image">
      <p>This holder attaches to the rod on the y-axis stepper motor. It holds our camera, our camera filter, and our laser
        being one of our most important components for camera tracking. The laser is put on in a way to keep the offset between
        the camera and laser almost constant no matter the distance. The camera slides into the back slot, and a smaller slot in front
        holds our filter. On the side the laser is put in (pressed fit in) to have it move with the camera. 
      </p>
       <div class="section-title">Reciever Model</div>
      <img src="images/reciever_assem.png" alt="Project image">
      <p>This is the model of our main reciever. The model allows us to insert our convex lens into the circle of the reciever
        with a press fit down, and includes holes in the corners of the circle to allow for the wiring of our two LEDs. The box is 
        wider on one side of the circle to allow for extra space to store the battery that powers our LEDs as well. 
      </p>
      <div class="section-title">Reciever Middle/Main Component</div>
      <img src="images/reciever_middle.png" alt="Project image">
      <p>This is the middle part of our reciever that on top as a cicular hole to allow for room of the lens. It also has holes
        for the IR LED wires. It is made a specifc width as the lens focuses light to a central points 50 mm behind it.
      </p>
      <div class="section-title">Reciever Top</div>
      <img src="images/reciever_top.png" alt="Project image">
      <p>This is the top of our led that is pushed down on the main body that keeps the lens in place. It provides holes to 
        let the wires for LEDs go through. 
      </p>
      <div class="section-title">Reciever Bottom</div>
      <img src="images/reciever_bottom.png" alt="Project image">
      <p>This is the bottom of our led that is press fitted on to the main body. The hole is placed parallel to the 
        middle of the circle, where the lens focuses the laser onto, which the hole contains our photodiodes.
