      <p>This image is our final assmebly for our ground station. It is entirly 3d printed. It features holdings for 
        two stepper motors, a raspberry pi, a lithium battery, two stepper motor drivers, a portable charger, and our camera.

      <div class="section-title">X-base stepper driver</div>
      <img src="images/x_stepper_holder.png" alt="Project image">
      <p>This part of the ground station holds our x-axis parts. This includes a motor driver (goes in right compartment), and our stepper motor
        (goes in left compartment). In the right compoartment room is also left to hold our lithium battery.

      <p>These parts all make up the covers that go on to the x-base stepper driver. The right image is the top side cover and 
        the left image is the bottom side cover. These were split into two parts to allow us to feed the power wires through the 
        made holes to easily let us plug and unplug our ground station. The top cover (middle image) then covers the right compartment, and comes with a hole 
        through it to allow us to feed the wires from the motor driver that need to connect to the raspberry pi. All parts including the motor are 
        screw pressed onto our ground station.
      </p>
      <div class="section-title">Y Axis Stepper holder</div>
      <img src="images/y_axis_stepper_holder.png" alt="Project image">
      <p>This is another main part that makes up our ground station. It holds our stepper motor for our y-axis movement for our tracking
        system, as well as the motor driver for it. It also has a spot right above where the motor compartment is to put our portable charger onto.
        This charger then powers our raspberry pi.
